        <p>A cold wind howls through the trees of an abandoned village,
             half-swallowed by the forest. The camera pans slowly across rotting houses
              and flickering lanterns, their flames trembling like they're afraid. A faint
               whisper, almost like a child's voice, echoes in the backgroundâ€”soft at first,
                then louder.Suddenly, a radio crackles to life inside one of the houses.
                 It's playing a forgotten lullaby... backwards. Footsteps approach. The
                  screen goes black.</p>
