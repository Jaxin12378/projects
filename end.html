    <h1 align="middle">The end</h1>
    <p>The lone survivor, Cristiano stumbles through the forest at dawn, bruised and bloodied. She clutches the ancient locket that seemed to hold the key to the curse. Behind her, the village smolders in silence — but no screams, no whispers. Just... silence.

She collapses by a tree, gasping for air. As the sun breaks through the mist, she finally smiles — the nightmare is over. Or so she thinks.

Suddenly, the trees around her begin to sway though there’s no wind. The radio in her backpack switches on by itself. The same lullaby plays… backwards.

Her smile fades.

A soft voice whispers from behind her:

"You brought it with you."

Her eyes widen in terror. The screen goes black.</p>
